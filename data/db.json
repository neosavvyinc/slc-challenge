      "brewery": "Uinta Brewing",
      "description": "DESCRIPTION: Rich and complex, this all malt barley wine exhibits hints of dried fruits, toffee and caramel balanced by an abundance of American hops. TASTING NOTES: Full malt taste, pleasant notes of nuts, chocolate, and dried fruit. Generously hoppy, delicately balancing the alcohol content. Finishes strong. Anniversary Barley Wine pairs well with cheeses such as blue cheese. STORY: First brewed in small batches annually to commemorate Uinta's anniversary, this soul-warming brew is now available year-round.",

      "name": "Bristlecone Brown Ale",
      "brewery": "Uinta Brewing",
      "description": "DESCRIPTION: Malty in character, this brown ale has a smooth body and a clean, well-rounded finish. TASTING NOTES: Bristlecone Brown is malt-accented, but with a firm, nutty dryness and gentle fruitiness that is reminiscent of the classic English nut brown style. Bristlecone Brown Ale pairs well with duck, roast pork, grilled salmon and smoked sausages. Complements the flavors found in peanut sauces as in chicken satay. Explore pairing with nutty desserts and those with pears. STORY: No bristlecones were harmed in the production of this brew. Named as a tribute to the regal Great Basin Bristlecone pine. Among these stately survivors is the 4,765 year-old Methuselah, the oldest living inhabitant of North America. Its exact location is kept secret as an older relative nicknamed \"Prometheus\" was unfortunately cut down in 1964.",
